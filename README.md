Purpose:
--------

spring_ext houses classes that I found have bugs in Spring's source. So far I'm only talking about the spring-oauth module of spring security.
I tried to raise an issue on the spring forums, but was banned for some unknown reason without explanation.

Building/Running:
----------------

This is a standard maven project, so `mvn clean install` should work provided you have maven on your path.
